# Helpful urls

The list service currently has three joruneys:

- **List** management
- **Apply** to be on the list
- **Find** a participant who is on the list

These all have different entry points (URLs) in the application which can be difficult to remember.

This document is to list a few of them out for reference reasons.

## 1. List Management

`/login`

## 2. Apply journey

### Locally

`localhost:3001/lawyers`

`localhost:3001/funeral-directors`

### On dev

`https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.forms.fcodev.org.uk/application/funeral-directors/`

## 3. Find journey

`/find?serviceType=lawyers`

`/find?serviceType=funeral-directors`
