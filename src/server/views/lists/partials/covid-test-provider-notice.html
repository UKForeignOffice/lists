  The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has compiled a list of COVID-19 test suppliers abroad. 
  British nationals can contact suppliers on the list to book a COVID-19 test before returning to the UK. 
  You can search for Covid test providers by:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>country</li>
  <li>specific area, city or postcode</li>
  <li>turnaround time of a test result</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">
  All test suppliers on the list have been contacted by the FCDO to make sure they have:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>good English language skills</li>
  <li>the same UK standards for COVID-19 testing</li>
  <li>up to date contact details</li>
</ul>
