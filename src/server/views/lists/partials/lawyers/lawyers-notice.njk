  The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) provides lists of English-speaking lawyers abroad to help British
  nationals find the legal support they need.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You can find lawyers:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>by country or a more specific location</li>
  <li>with a particular area of legal expertise</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">
  All lawyers on the lists have confirmed they can provide services in English.

  <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
    <span class="govuk-warning-text__assistive">Warning</span>
    You should do your own research before deciding which provider to use. You may also want to check if any insurance
    policies you have include legal cover before you contact a lawyer independently.
