<p class="govuk-body">
  The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has created a list
  of lawyers abroad to help British nationals find the legal support they
  need. You can search lawyers by:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>country</li>
  <li>region</li>
  <li>area of expertise</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">
  All lawyers on the list have been contacted by the FCDO to make sure they
  have:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>good English language skills</li>
  <li>legal qualifications</li>
  <li>up to date contact details</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">
  It is recommended that you own research before deciding which lawyer to
  use.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Lawyers feedback</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  The FCDO welcomes feedback from people who have used lawyers from the
  list. We use this feedback to make sure all information is up to date and
  accurate.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  The FCDO will quickly respond to feedback and will remove any lawyer from
  the list where appropriate.
