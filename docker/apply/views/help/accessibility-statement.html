      <p>This service is run by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).</p>
      <p>
        It uses <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gov.uk" target="_blank">GOV.UK</a>
        typography (for example, text size) and form elements (for example, buttons) which have been tested to ensure
        they are accessible. The text should be clear and easy to understand.
      </p>

      <h2>Schedule for accessibility testing</h2>
      <p>
        This service is scheduled for user testing in early 2022. These tests will be in line with Web Content
        Accessibility Guidelines v2.0, and 2.1 to ensure maximum ease of use for people with visual impairments,
        dyslexia, mobility impairments and learning disabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Weâ€™ll publish the results of that user testing and try to fix any accessibility problems when we have the
        results.
      </p>
